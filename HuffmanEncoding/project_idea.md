**Project Title: Efficient Data Compression and Transmission Using Huffman Encoding**  

**Project Overview:**  
Data compression is a crucial technique in artificial intelligence, data storage, and communication systems. This project aims to implement Huffman Encoding, a widely used lossless compression algorithm, and apply it to a real-world problem. The implementation will focus on encoding and decoding text-based data efficiently. Additionally, the project will explore a relevant AI-driven application, such as optimizing model storage in machine learning, compressing chatbot datasets, or reducing transmission latency in NLP applications.  

**Objectives:**  
1. Implement Huffman Encoding for text compression, including encoding and decoding functions.  
2. Compare the efficiency of Huffman Encoding with other lossless compression techniques in terms of space and time complexity.  
3. Apply Huffman Encoding to a real-world AI use case, such as:  
   - Compressing training datasets for NLP models to reduce storage and memory usage.  
   - Efficiently transmitting large chatbot response logs or embeddings in AI applications.  
   - Optimizing data storage in AI-driven cloud platforms.  
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of Huffman Encoding in the chosen application by measuring compression ratio, processing speed, and decompression accuracy.  

**Expected Outcomes:**  
- A working implementation of Huffman Encoding in Python or C++.  
- A real-world AI-based application demonstrating its practical utility.  
- Performance analysis comparing Huffman Encoding with other compression methods.  
- A report summarizing findings, challenges, and improvements.
